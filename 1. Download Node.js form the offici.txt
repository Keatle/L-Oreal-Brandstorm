1. Download Node.js form the official website and install it.
	- after that use VS Code to create a folder for your backend.

2. Download these extensions as they make your coding easier:
	- ESLint: Helps catch JavaScript errors and enforce coding standards.
	- Prettier - Code Formatter: Automatically formats your code to look clean.
	- nNode.js Essentials: Provides Node.js snippets and debugging tools.
	- REST Client (optional): Allows you to test your API endpoints directly within 	  VS Code.
	- Path Intellisense: Helps autocomplete file paths while coding.
	  Search for "Path Intellisense" in the extensions marketplace.
	- Code Runner: Lets you quickly run your Node.js files directly from VS Code.
	  Search for "Code Runner" in the marketplace and install it.
	- Debugger for Node.js: Provides debugging tools for Node.js apps.
	  Built into VS Code, but you can search "Node.js Debugger" if it's missing.
	- npm Intellisense: Autocompletes require statements for npm packages.
	  Search for "npm Intellisense" and install it.

3. Close VS  Code and install express.js by
	- Opening cmd and runing these commands:
	- cd "C:\Users\nqobi\My_Files\School\Projects\L'Oreal BrandStorm 2025\nok-loreal-backend"
	- npm install express
	- This will be the response you get: 
	added 69 packages in 5s

	14 packages are looking for funding
  	run npm fund for details

4. Then write your test code to see if the API is running:
	- Create a file called 'index.js' and write this code:

// Import the Express module
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 5000;

// Middleware to parse JSON requests
app.use(express.json());

// Test route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('API is working!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});

5. Run your code by opening terminal and running 'node index.js'
	- This should be the response you get: 'Server is running on http://localhost:5000'
	- Open your browser and run http://localhost:5000, you should see a page with the words 'Your API is workingh'
	- Done your test API is working. You can now get started.
